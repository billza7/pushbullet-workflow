# pushbullet-workflow

This is my first workflow and my knowledge about coding is very limited so feel free to suggest anything, however small.
Basically this workflow allows you to push (send) any text or the current website to your pushbullet account. This is especially useful for:
those that own multiple devices and want to push something to all devices at once
own an android, windows, or chromebook devices and want to bridge the gap with your MacOS device. 

You can download the workflow here.
Instructions
1. Login to Pushbullet.com. 
2. Get your API access token from https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings
3. Paste the token into the script, replacing the <API access token here>.
4. You can type push followed by any text and press return. To send the current tab, type push url.

Bonus: if you want to see your android notifications, or push something to your Mac from an android, use Noti.center which also uses pushbullet. You can push something to Mac by pushing it to your android, and it will mirror up to the Mac as well.
